- What does your AI chatbot do?
    
    Our AI chatbot is an automated system that instantly responds to callers when you're unavailable and engages with prospects or customers via text messaging. When someone calls during busy times or outside business hours, the AI sends them a text message, starts a conversation, and captures their information and needs. This ensures every caller receives immediate attention and no potential customer slips through the cracks.
    
    The chatbot is trained on your business information—including FAQs, website content, and product or service documentation—so it can provide tailored responses to customer inquiries.
    
    Here's what our AI chatbot can do:
    
    - Answer missed calls and engage customers through text conversations
    - Answer questions about your business, products, and services
    - Capture leads with its lead agent, ensuring no opportunity is lost
    - Schedule appointments with prospects or customers using its scheduling agent
- How can customers interact with the AI chatbot?
    
    Customers can interact with the AI chatbot regardless of where your customers reach out including by phone, text messaging and web. When you miss a call, the chatbot immediately responds to callers via text. Customers can also start a conversation by texting "hello" to your number. The chatbot will then engage them and assist with any inquiries.
    
- What does multi-channel chatbot mean?
    
    Multi-channel chatbot means our AI system can communicate with your customers across multiple platforms simultaneously - including SMS text messages and website chat. Instead of managing separate tools for each platform, you get one unified AI assistant that maintains consistent conversations and captures leads regardless of where your customers prefer to reach out. This ensures seamless customer experience and prevents missed opportunities across all your communication channels.
    
- How does the AI chatbot work?
    
    Our AI chatbot uses advanced natural language processing to understand and respond to customer inquiries in real-time. When someone contacts your business, the chatbot analyzes their message, searches through your business information (website content, FAQs, product details), and provides accurate, contextual responses. It can handle multiple conversations simultaneously, escalate complex issues to you when needed, and continuously learns from interactions to improve its responses over time.
    
- Do I need a website for the AI chatbot to work?
    
    No, you don't need a website! Our AI assistant can have conversations with your customers over text messaging. It can be trained on FAQs and other information about your business from PDF files or other file types.
